      <h1>Our Story & Mission</h1>
      <p>Providing care that feels like home—because it is.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content">
      <h2>Family-Owned. Resident-Focused.</h2>
      <p>Brookside Manor began with a vision: to create a residential care facility that doesn’t feel like an institution, but like a real home. As a family-owned RCF-1 facility in Missouri, we believe that true care starts with connection. That’s why we focus on creating a space filled with warmth, familiarity, and dignity for every resident.</p>

      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p>We’re not a nursing home. We’re not assisted living. We are the middle ground—offering support where needed while honoring independence where possible. Every room is furnished to feel like home, every meal is cooked with love, and every interaction is grounded in compassion and respect.</p>

      <blockquote class="quote-block">
        <p>“We don’t believe in hospital beds and hallways. We believe in cozy couches, warm kitchens, and friendly faces.”</p>

      <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li>Real furniture, not medical fixtures</li>
        <li>Personal relationships with every resident</li>
        <li>Private and shared suites with homey charm</li>
        <li>Daily activities that feel like hobbies, not chores</li>
        <li>A team that truly cares—and it shows</li>
      </ul>
